Changes:

Remove: 

"TLS only requires authentication of the server side
 of the communication channel; authentication of the client
 side is optional."

Unfortunately not true, as described in "Opportunistic TLS" below

Remove: 
"Note that with typical email use of TLS, authentication only is
 performed for the target receiving server and is not done for
 the sending client. That is, it serves to validate that the
 connection has been made to the intended server, but does not
 validate who initiated it."

Same reason.


Enforced TLS:

Old:

"While they differ in their implementation details, receiving
servers relying on either protocol are stating that they
only accept mail if the transmission can be encrypted with
TLS, and a failure to negotiate a secure connection MUST
result in the sending client refusing to transmit the
message. Support for both protocols is increasing, but is
not yet mandatory."

New:

"While they differ in their implementation details, receiving
servers relying on either protocol can state that they
only accept mail if the transmission can be encrypted with
TLS. Support for both protocols is increasing, but is
not yet mandatory."

At least MTA-STS has modes that don't require the client MUST use encryption. Better not to restate the requirements in those drafts.

Move Message-Level Confidentiality up under TLS to make other edits easier.

Remove:
"If the sending client does not implement or understand the protocol requested by the receiving server, the sending client will use Opportunistic TLS or clear-text to transmit the message."

This is only true sometimes, I think. Its contradicts the MUST removed above, and the "there is no fallback" text above as well. For example, it does not describe GMail:
https://support.google.com/a/answer/9261504?hl=en

That's why they have TLS Reporting too.

Remove:
", and most receiving servers implementations will be expected to be capable of receiving such messages."

But still leaves the requirement to disable it.
